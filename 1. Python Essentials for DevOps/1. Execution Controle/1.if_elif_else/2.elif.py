'''
Here we used the == operator, which returns True if items are equal and False if not. 
Optionally, this block can follow an elif or else statement with an accompanying block. 
In the case of an elif statement, this block only executes if the elif evaluates to True:
'''

i = 35
if i == 45:
    print('i is 45')
elif i == 35:
    print('i is 35')
